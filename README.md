# Python Minecraft DJ
 The greatest DJ is a robot who's job is smashing a wall of noteblocks.

## The noteblock range
The noteblocks in minecraft only cover 25 notes (for multiple instruments)
The bot (dummy_thicc) works by reading midi files and converting the midi note to a range on a board of noteblocks, which it uses to punch a correct note.
